\item{p_values}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, adjusted p-values for equivalence testing are calculated.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle off warnings.}

\details{
\subsection{Calculation of equivalence testing}{
  \describe{
    \item{"bayes" - Bayesian rule (Kruschke 2018)}{
      This rule follows the \dQuote{HDI+ROPE decision rule} \cite{(Kruschke, 2014, 2018)}
      used for the \code{\link[bayestestR:equivalence_test]{Bayesian counterpart}}.
      This means, if the confidence intervals are completely outside the ROPE,
      the "null hypothesis" for this parameter is "rejected". If the ROPE
      completely covers the CI, the null hypothesis is accepted. Else, it's
      undecided whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. Desirable
      results are low proportions inside the ROPE (the closer to zero the better).
    }
    \item{"classic" - The TOST rule (Lakens 2017)}{
      This rule follows the \dQuote{TOST rule}, i.e. a two one-sided test
      procedure (\cite{Lakens 2017}). Following this rule, practical equivalence
      of an effect (i.e. H0) is \emph{rejected}, when the coefficient is statistically
      significant \emph{and} the narrow confidence intervals (i.e. \code{1-2*alpha})
      \emph{include} or \emph{exceed} the ROPE boundaries. Practical equivalence
      is assumed (i.e. H0 accepted) when the narrow confidence intervals are
      completely inside the ROPE, no matter if the effect is statistically
      significant or not. Else, the decision whether to accept or reject H0 is
      undecided.
    }
    \item{"cet" - Conditional Equivalence Testing (Campbell/Gustafson 2018)}{
      The Conditional Equivalence Testing as described by \cite{Campbell and Gustafson 2018}.
      According to this rule, practical equivalence is rejected when the
      coefficient is statistically significant. When the effect is \emph{not}
      significant and the narrow confidence intervals are completely inside the ROPE,
      we accept H0, else it is undecided.
    }
  }
}
\subsection{Levels of Confidence Intervals used for Equivalence Testing}{
  For \code{rule = "cet"}, "narrow" confidence intervals are used for
  equivalence testing. "Narrow" means, the the intervals is not 1 - alpha,
  but 1 - 2 * alpha. Thus, if \code{ci = .95}, alpha is assumed to be 0.05
  and internally a ci-level of 0.90 is used. \code{rule = "classic"} uses
  both regular and narrow confidence intervals, while \code{rule = "bayes"}
  only uses the regular intervals.
}
\subsection{Adjustment for multiple testing}{
  The calculation of p-values is somewhat "experimental". For parameters, where H0...
  \itemize{
    \item ... is rejected, the p-value equals a NHST as if the upper / lower boundary of the ROPE (see \code{range}) would be the point-null to test against.
    \item ... is accepted, the p-value is set to 1.
    \item ... is undecided, the p-value equals a NHST against the point-null, however, the "uncertainty" (i.e. ROPE range) is added to the confidence intervals (so the upper confidence interval limit equals the regular upper confidence interval limit + half the ROPE range).
  }
  All p-values are then adjusted for multiple testing (using \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} with \code{method = "fdr"}).
}
\subsection{ROPE range}{
  Some attention is required for finding suitable values for the ROPE limits
  (argument \code{range}). See 'Details' in \code{\link[bayestestR]{rope_range}}
  for further information.
}
}
\note{
Depending on the \code{rule}, the \code{plot()} methods displays the narrow
confidence intervals, and the regular confidence intervals are the longer, blue
lines.
