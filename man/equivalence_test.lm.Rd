to automatically define this range based on properties of the model's data.}

\item{p_values}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, adjusted p-values for equivalence testing are calculated.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle off warnings.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{effects}{Should parameters for fixed effects, random effects or both be returned? Only applies to mixed models. May be abbreviated.}

A data frame.

Compute the equivalence test for frequentist models.

\details{
\subsection{Calculation of equivalence testing}{
  Note that \code{equivalence_test()} in \pkg{parameters} \emph{does not} implement
  the method suggested by \cite{Campbell & Gustafson 2018} or \cite{Lakens 2017},
  because we consider the rules to "reject" the "null hypotheses", when based
  on these approaches, to be too similar to classical NHST. We therefore decided
  for the \strong{Test for Practical Equivalence} for frequentist models to follow
  the \dQuote{HDI+ROPE decision rule} \cite{(Kruschke, 2014, 2018)} used for
  the \code{\link[bayestestR:equivalence_test]{Bayesian counterpart}}. This means,
  if the confidence intervals are completely outside the ROPE, the "null hypothesis"
  for this parameter is "rejected". If the ROPE completely covers the CI, the
  null hypothesis is accepted. Else, it's undecided whether to accept or reject
  the null hypothesis. Desirable results are low proportions inside the ROPE
  (the closer to zero the better).
  \cr \cr
  Some attention is required for finding suitable values for the ROPE limits
  (argument \code{range}). See 'Details' in \code{\link[bayestestR]{rope_range}}
  for further information.
}
\subsection{Adjustment for multiple testing}{
  The calculation of p-values is somewhat "experimental". For parameters, where H0...
  \itemize{
    \item ... is rejected, the p-value equals a NHST as if the upper / lower boundary of the ROPE (see \code{range}) would be the point-null to test against.
    \item ... is accepted, the p-value is set to 1.
    \item ... is undecided, the p-value equals a NHST against the point-null, however, the "uncertainty" (i.e. ROPE range) is added to the confidence intervals (so the upper confidence interval limit equals the regular upper confidence interval limit + half the ROPE range).
  }
  All p-values are then adjusted for multiple testing (using \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} with \code{method = "fdr"}).
