# Variable Extraction

Also known as [feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction) in machine learning, the goal of variable reduction is to **reduce the number of predictors** by derivating, from a set of measured data, new variables intended to be informative and non-redundant. This method can be used to **simplify models**, which can benefit model interpretation, shorten fitting time, and improve generalization (by reducing overfitting).
